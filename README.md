# Machine Learning Repository

This repository is an playground to implement any type of machine learning algorihtm.

**Currently Implemented Algorithms:**

## Neural Networks
* restricted boltzmann machine with dynamic numbers of hidden neurons


## Development Notes
* install python requirements in virtualenvironment based on `requirements.txt`.
* docs are created by running `make html` inside `doc/` directory
* tests are run by executing `nosetests` in the root of the project (use `nosetests --nocapture` to also see print statements, to run a single test use e.g. `nosetests path.to.module:Class.test_method`)
