Welcome to Collection of Machine Learning Algorithms's documentation!
=====================================================================


This repository is an playground to implement any type of machine learning algorihtm.

**Currently Implemented Algorithms:**

## Neural Networks

* restricted boltzmann machine with dynamic numbers of hidden neurons
* single layer perceptron (binary classification, multinominal classification has to be done with a one vs all strategy)
* single layer perceptron (binary and multinominal classification)
